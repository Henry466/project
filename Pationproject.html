<p>He often spent his playtime building complex designs with Legos, but when he ran into his father’s Commodore 128 home computer, he started programming and creating games on cowboys and Indians. </p>

<p>He developed his first game, a text-based adventure game, at a tender age of eight years, after experimenting with a number of type-in programs.</p>

    <p> In 2005 He Created The 4k Series, A Bunch Of Games That <b class= red>Only</b> Took Up 4kb of Space <b>Which Is Impresive</b> Beacause This File Is <em>2</em> kb And This Line is .3 kb <em>So</em> The Games Took Up <b class= red>Only</b> 15x This Line</p>
